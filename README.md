# Sashimi

A utility library for the Godot Game Engine.
It provides basic data structures and functions that work without the editor.
Everything is contained in a single standalone script that can be easily copied into a project with no extra setup required.

> [!WARNING]
> This is alpha software. Use it only if you are very cool.

## Examples

Look at the [app.gd](source/app.gd) file.

## Note

I add things to Sashimi when I need them and I support only Godot 4.
