# Sashimi

A utility library for the Godot Engine.
It provides data structures and functions that work without the editor.
Everything is contained in a single standalone script that can be easily copied into a project.

> [!WARNING]
> This is alpha software. Use it only if you are very cool.

## Examples

Look at the [app.gd](source/app.gd) file.

## Note

I add things to Sashimi when I need them.
This is also a Godot 4 project.
